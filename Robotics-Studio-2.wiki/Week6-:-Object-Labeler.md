To train the object detector first we need to create a dataset with label

We will be using the Label Img tool to label the data. Clone this repository and install it and run.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg.git

``` 
More information about the installation can be found here. Depending on your python version install correct dependencies.

**Remember to select the YOLO from the menu. Otherwise, labels would not save in the correct format**.
